# Introduction

This is my first post for Fatigue Failure.  

I had a blog called [Craic Propagation](https://craicpropagation.blogspot.com) for years on Blogspot.  It satisfied 
my urge to write.  I focused on a narrow list of topics: fitness, technology, self-improvement, public speaking.

I'm beginning another effort here that I'm calling Fatigue Failure.  It will be more focused on 
[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) and machine learning.

I've obtained a copy of 
["Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch"](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1AZO7DUUKPKBC&dchild=1&keywords=deep+learning+for+coders+with+fastai+and+pytorch&qid=1619484844&sprefix=deep+learning+for+coders+with+%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-1) 
by Jeremy Howard & Slyvain Gugger.  I've watched all the [videos](https://course.fast.ai/) once.  Now it's time to carefully 
work through the code and internalize how to work with fast.ai.

I set up this blog on GitHub pages using Appendix A instructions from the book.  The template
allows me to write with markdown, LaTeX, and include Jupyter notebooks.  I want to hold myself
accountable by making my progress public.  It's easier to make progress when it's measured.

My goal is to learn how to do machine learning well enough to enter Kaggle competitions, create and deploy models.

Let's begin.
