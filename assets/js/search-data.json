DataSpell is making it fun. Let&#39;s add a function: . def say_hello(recipient): return &#39;Hello, {}!&#39;.format(recipient) say_hello(&#39;Michael&#39;) . &#39;Hello, Michael!&#39; . Jupyter notebook does a great job of keep code and documentation together. It&#39;s a scientific revolution. I think this is the best hope we have for maintaining that scientific ideal of making results public and easily reproducible by others. . I&#39;ll have to dig into LaTeX for math typesetting. What does that look like? . Euler&#39;s identity: $$e^{i pi} + 1 = 0$$ $$ frac{arg 1}{arg 2}$$ $$x^2$$ $$e^{i pi}$$ $$A_i$$ $$B_{ij}$$ $$ sqrt[n]{arg}$$ . Here&#39;s a linear equation: . $$ hat{Y} = hat{ beta_0} + sum_{j=1}^p hat{ beta}_j X_j $$ . The tutorial has a bunch of markdown examples that aren&#39;t hard to understand. No sense memorizing these. I&#39;ll Google them when I need them. . Level 1 heading . Level 2 heading . Text is easy to format: . bold italic . Lists are simple: . First element | Second element | First bullet | Second bullet | . I created hyperlinks earlier. . It&#39;s easy to add code. I hope to be able to add Python, R, and Kotlin someday soon. . fun foo() . Here&#39;s a code block: . fun bar() = &quot;This could be some Kotlin code&quot; . You can also tab in: . fun baz(): return &#39;A Python string&#39; . What about images? Let&#39;s add an image of a dog: . . That&#39;s enough markdown. This is about code. Does DataSpell give me access to numpy? . import numpy as np def square(q): return q*q x = np.random.randint(1, 10) y = square(x) print(&#39;%d squared is %d&#39; % (x, y)) . 3 squared is 9 . Now I have numpy. The tutorial tells me that there are kernels for over 100 languages, including Java, C, Fortran, R, and Kotlin. There&#39;s an SoS kernel that provides multi-language support within a single notebook. I&#39;ll stick to Python for now, but I can&#39;t wait to try out both R and Kotlin. . Enough about notebook mechanics. What about a real analysis? . The tutorial problem uses a Fortune 500 data set. . %matplotlib inline import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns sns.set(style=&quot;darkgrid&quot;) df = pd.read_csv(&#39;../datasets/fortune500.csv&#39;) len(df) df.columns = [&#39;year&#39;, &#39;rank&#39;, &#39;company&#39;, &#39;revenue&#39;, &#39;profit&#39;] df.dtypes non_numeric_profits = df.profit.str.contains(&#39;[^0-9.-]&#39;) df.loc[non_numeric_profits].head() set(df.profit[non_numeric_profits]) len(df.profit[non_numeric_profits]) . 369 . len(df.profit[non_numeric_profits])/len(df) . 0.014470588235294117 . Looks like 1.447% of our rows are missing profit data. There&#39;s an easy way to draw a histogram: . bin_sizes, _, _ = plt.hist(df.year[non_numeric_profits], bins=range(1955,2006)) df = df.loc[~non_numeric_profits] df.profit = df.profit.apply(pd.to_numeric) len(df) . 25131 .",

I focused on a narrow list of topics: fitness, technology, self-improvement, public speaking. . I’m beginning another effort here that I’m calling Fatigue Failure. It will be more focused on fast.ai and machine learning. . I’ve obtained a copy of “Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch” by Jeremy Howard &amp; Slyvain Gugger. I’ve watched all the videos once. Now it’s time to carefully work through the code and internalize how to work with fast.ai. . I set up this blog on GitHub pages using Appendix A instructions from the book. The template allows me to write with markdown, LaTeX, and include Jupyter notebooks. I want to hold myself accountable by making my progress public. It’s easier to make progress when it’s measured. . My goal is to learn how to do machine learning well enough to enter Kaggle competitions, create and deploy models. . Let’s begin. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
